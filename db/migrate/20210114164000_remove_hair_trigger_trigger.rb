class RemoveHairTriggerTrigger < ActiveRecord::Migration

  # Hairtrigger seems to be having problems with the database index I needed to remove for physical_object_old_barcodes so
  # now doing the recording of changed barcodes manually. Need to remove the hairtrigger generated trigger because it results
  # in sporadic duplication of the barcode change.
